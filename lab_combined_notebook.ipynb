    "1. EDIT MULTIPLE FIELDS:\n",
    "   - Modify the demo to correct multiple fields at once\n",
    "   - Update customer name, address, and email simultaneously\n",
    "   - Observe how update_state() merges changes\n",
    "       \n",
    "2. ADD APPROVAL STEP:\n",
    "   - Add a new node \"manager_approval\" after validation\n",
    "   - Use interrupt_before=[\"manager_approval\"]\n",
    "   - Let manager edit and approve/reject via state updates\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. IMPLEMENT CORRECTION LOOP:\n",
    "   - Add conditional edge from validate_data\n",
    "   - If validation fails, route back to extract_data\n",
    "   - Allow up to 3 correction attempts\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. CREATE VALIDATION HISTORY:\n",
    "   - Add \"validation_history\" list to state\n",
    "   - Record each validation attempt with timestamp\n",
    "   - Show full correction history before final approval\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. BUILD REVIEW INTERFACE:\n",
    "   - Create a function that displays all fields for review\n",
    "   - Prompt for which field to edit\n",
    "   - Apply the edit using update_state()\n",
    "   - Repeat until representative approves\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. ADD COMPLIANCE CHECKS:\n",
    "   - Create a new node for compliance validation\n",
    "   - Check age (must be 18+)\n",
    "   - Check deposit amount limits\n",
    "   - Pause for compliance officer review if issues found\n",
    "   \n",
    "7. TEST INCOMPLETE APPLICATIONS:\n",
    "   - Create applications with missing required fields\n",
    "   - See how AI marks them as \"NEEDS_REVIEW\"\n",
    "   - Practice editing the state to fill in missing data"

    "### Lab 4 Exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ADD SENTIMENT ANALYSIS:\n",
    "    - After each customer response, analyze sentiment\n",
    "    - Auto-escalate if sentiment is negative\n",
    "    - Add sentiment_score to state\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. IMPLEMENT CONVERSATION TIMEOUT:\n",
    "    - Track time between responses\n",
    "    - If customer doesn't respond for 3 turns, send follow-up\n",
    "    - Add timeout_warnings to state\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. CREATE KNOWLEDGE BASE LOOKUP:\n",
    "    - Add a node that searches knowledge base\n",
    "    - Include before AI response\n",
    "    - Show AI using retrieved information\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. BUILD CONVERSATION SUMMARY:\n",
    "    - After each turn, generate a summary\n",
    "    - Add conversation_summary to state\n",
    "    - Use for context in next AI response\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. ADD CUSTOMER SATISFACTION SURVEY:\n",
    "    - After resolution, ask for satisfaction rating\n",
    "    - Use interrupt() to get rating\n",
    "    - Store in customer_satisfaction field\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. IMPLEMENT MULTI-AGENT HANDOFF:\n",
    "    - Create different types of human agents (billing, technical, fraud)\n",
    "    - Route escalations to appropriate specialist\n",
    "    - Add agent_type to escalation logic\n",
    "    \n",
    "7. CREATE CONVERSATION ANALYTICS:\n",
    "    - Track average conversation turns\n",
    "    - Calculate resolution rate\n",
    "    - Measure escalation percentage\n",
    "    - Add analytics_data to state\n",
    "    \n",
    "8. TEST DIFFERENT SCENARIOS:\n",
    "    - Password reset (should resolve quickly)\n",
    "    - Fraud report (should escalate immediately)\n",
    "    - General inquiry (might resolve without escalation)\n",
    "    - Angry customer (should escalate)"
